Counting cars with YOLO Models using Pre-recorded Videos project aims to develop a computer vision system that can accurately count the number of cars passing through a specific area using pre-existing video recordings. The system utilizes advanced object detection algorithms based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture.

The project involves several key steps. 
Initially, a collection of pre-recorded videos of the target area is obtained, either from public surveillance cameras or other available sources. These videos serve as the input for the vehicle counting system. YOLO's ability to efficiently analyze and detect objects in real-time makes it well-suited for this task. The model's pre-existing knowledge allows it to recognize and locate different types of vehicles accurately. The system then counts the identified vehicles, maintaining a tally of the vehicles as they appear in the video. The system generates total number of vehicles counted.

The Vehicle Counting with YOLO Models using Pre-recorded Videos project holds significant potential for various applications. It can be utilized for retrospective traffic analysis, historical traffic studies, and transportation planning.
